Hello and welcome to my GitHub page,

I am a Mathematics teacher looking to pivot into a career in tech.
After creating some projects on Desmos, which is graphing calculating website, during lockdown; 
I took my first steps towards learning a programming language called computational layer, which is their own programming language for their website.  

Once I had dipped my toes into programming, I was then fascinated and hooked, I started courses on Codecademy, before then applying for a competitive place on a skills bootcamp run by HyperionDev. I have now completed my program in Cyber Security with 100% on all assignments, which is an achievement I take pride in.

 I am now looking for the opportunity to show people within the tech sector what I am capable of after the completion of my 3 month long bootcamp, as well as the projects and additional learning I have been completing during this time period.
